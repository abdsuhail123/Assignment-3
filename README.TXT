============================================

1) Phase 6: Incomplete. Could not figure
            out because its almost 8:00am
            and my mind refuses to think.

============================================

2) Got Error in Multiple Classes

  "Item class is abstract, cannot be 
   instantiated"

  I figure that is because I need to change
  new Item variables being created to either
  EquipableItem, or StackableItem, 
  specifically.

============================================
